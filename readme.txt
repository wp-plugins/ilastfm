1. Important: The folder `/cache` need to be writable, otherwise the cache will not work

1. Listen to some music and relax (:

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The cache option does not appear, why? =

This probably happens because the folder /cache (inside of /ilastfm) doesn't can be writable. To solve this problem, use an FTP, go to folder cache and try put CHMOD 775.

= How do I clear the cache? =

Go to iLast.Fm Options and simply click in "Save Settings". Done.

= Where i can get more help, tips and informations? =
